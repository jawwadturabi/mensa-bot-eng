User: hi.
Bot: -----------EVALUATION-----------  
* Thank you * for participating in the evaluation! 
First, I ask you to complete the steps under _Instructions_, and then to participate in a short [survey] (https://forms.gle/jD4dpVW9DsjVKr2V7). 

_Instructions_ 

Please ask me your own questions with the following requirements by sending them to me in writing as a message: 
 
- Opening times from the main canteen TU Hardenbergstraße 
- Address of the canteen Veggie 2.0 - the deep green canteen 
- all dishes today in the Café TU Skyline and in the cafeteria in Marchstrasse 
- all vegan and green marked dishes on Wednesday in the cafeteria in Marchstrasse 
- all dishes without cereals containing gluten in the main canteen TU Hardenbergstraße 

You don't have to write out the names of the dining halls completely. Try the abbreviations you know. Of course, you can test other questions beyond the above. 
It may well be that I don't understand you yet because I don't know your wording of the question. Please try to ask your question differently. I will add the unknown wording after the evaluation. 
If you want to see this message again while chatting, enter _Hello_.
